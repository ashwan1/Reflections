Que: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans: I would most likely to it when creating new project with collaboration with other friends. Also if I want to make my new project open source so that everyone can see and contribute to it to make it better. I will also do this because I myself love open source.

Que: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans: Github is more likely to be used for collaboration. So I someone make changes to my repository and it automatically gets updated with my local, then my local may end up with changes that I don't want in my project. It will also increase chances for notorious people to corrupt my project. Thus its better to review first on github and then pull changes if we want.

Que: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Ans: Fork is cloning of someone repository to our own repository only on github. Most likely to do this when don't have permission to modify another person's repository or want to maintain my own repository.
Clones basically means copying one repository onto local or onto github
Branches are like different path on commit history. If we want to make some change but don't want to mess up things in original content then we use branch command to create another branch.

Que: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Ans: We can work on it offline and push changes back on github when have internet access.

Que: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Ans: We can colaborate using some shared document over internet services like outlook or g-drive. But that will not provide with features that we are getting in github. Moreover, most tasks will need to done manually.
