Que: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans: I would most likely to it when creating new project with collaboration with other friends. Also if I want to make my new project open source so that everyone can see and contribute to it to make it better. I will also do this because I myself love open source.

Que: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans: Github is more likely to be used for collaboration. So I someone make changes to my repository and it automatically gets updated with my local, then my local may end up with changes that I don't want in my project. It will also increase chances for notorious people to corrupt my project. Thus its better to review first on github and then pull changes if we want.
